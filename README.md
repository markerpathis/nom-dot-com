## Description

My objective of this solo project was to create a react app to continue practicing my React skills, after finsihing my coding bootcamp course through UW.

Nom Dot Com, is a recipe app, which allows users to save, edit, and search for recipes.

This current deployment is my MVP, but there is plenty more I will be continuing to add!
